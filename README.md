# kadictionary-desktop

* “KA Dictionary desktop” is a desktop application that is a part of “KA Dictionary” project. The aim of “KA Dictionary” is to create a bank of kyrgyz language and translations to other languages. One of the main ideas of the project to create morphological and syntactic lexer of the language and to build a natural language processing system for it.

* This desktop application allows users to find descriptions and translations of words in two languages, kyrgyz and arabic (for now). Its architecture is designed to support multiple languages as well (in the future). The application uses JavaFX GUI library and stores data on MySQL database server (locally for now).
